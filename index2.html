    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p> Writing is, at the moment, the thing that interests me the most. Writing is such a freeing, calming thing for me, especially when it comes without pressure or expectation. <br> <br> Creative writing is probably my favorite. You can create worlds, characters, entire political structures, buildings, conflicts and relationships, and it is entirely yours. It can be whatever you'd like it to be, and I find those endless possibilities that exist in a pen stroke or the flurry of typing fascinating! <br> <br> I also find the laid back, more peaceful style of writing, which is most prevalent in blogging, incredibly pleasant. Main elements include loose grammar, shorter paragraphs, conversational words and simple vocabulary. I'm currently not very good at it, but it's really fun. <br><br> Theatre writing, as in writing screenplays, cinematic productions and plays, is also very fascinating to me. I personally don't do it very often, but I find the structure and format very interesting and refreshing, and I love to pick it apart and analyse it. <br> <br> Want to write something yourself but don't know where to start?
